## Hi there 👋

I am a Software and Quality Engineer with 14 years of experience delivering high-quality systems through sound software development practices and robust automation frameworks aimed at  UI , API , transactions or special systems .

I have tangible experience leading test automation initiatives as well as building fullstack applications , embedded applications, mobile applications.
My approach is rooted in careful requirement analysis and leveraging cutting-edge tools to work with  Agile, cross-functional teams.

After over a decade in Automation testing , I have recently reconnected with my software development roots to "shore" up my full stack and cloud management skills.

### Automation engineer or Software Engineer

I began my career as a Software Engineer within the gaming industry, where I spent over five years honing my fundamental development skills. Recognizing a critical need for technical rigor in Quality Assurance, I transitioned into Integration Testing—a role that has evolved into a 10-year focus on Automation Architecture. Driven by a commitment to system integrity and performance, I leverage my engineering background to bridge the gap between development and quality. I operate under a 'Top Stack' philosophy: maintaining a high level of proficiency in both software and cloud engineering to ensure that I can architect, build, and validate systems with equal expertise.
